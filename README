Create React App Generation
updated 8-4-2020

In the next lecture, Stephen will be going over how to install Create React App globally and generate the application. This method of generating a React project is no longer recommended.

Instead of this:

npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app client

We need to run this command:

npx create-react-app client

Important Reminder:

Once you have generated the React app you will need to delete the local git repository that Create React App may have automatically initialized.

Inside the newly created client directory, run rm -r .git

If you miss this step, the client folder will be considered a submodule and pushed as an empty folder to GitHub.

Documentation:

https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#npx

If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.


-------------------------

In the next lecture, we will be adding a client and worker service. There are two required configuration updates that need to be made:

1) When adding the "Client" service, be sure to include the stdin_open: true configuration:

  client:
    stdin_open: true
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      context: ./client
    volumes:
      - /app/node_modules
      - ./client:/app
Otherwise, you will get a "React App exited with Code 0" error in your terminal when we attempt to start up the application.

2) When adding the "Worker" service, include the Redis host and port as environment variables:

  worker:
    build:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      context: ./worker
    volumes:
      - /app/node_modules
      - ./worker:/app
    environment:
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
      - REDIS_PORT=6379
Otherwise, you will get a "Calculated Nothing Yet" error message.
